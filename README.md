## Project Planning:
Upon identifying the project concept, I developed multiple schemas to accurately represent the data sets involved. Mapping out the schema relationships, I utilized Trello as a project management tool to define and monitor AAU stories. This framework facilitated the implementation of CRUD operations and foundational authorization protocols, ensuring a robust and secure system architecture.
